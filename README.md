Kait's Portfolio Read-Me
Abstract:I have deployed to Heroku. Attempt at Markdown screenshot is below. I used a PHP validator to incorporate a phone number. I will get to putting my resume on the site(but seriously, putting personal stuff on a site like that is how nice Irish girls get kidnapped.I'm not kidding. My Aunt Barbara is guilting me right now and referencing an episode of Sally Jesse Raphael or Oprah. She doesn't even know I've thought about doing that stuff. It's the guilt). Website is polished. Snowflakes are gone. I got rid of an outside curly bracket somewhere and had to ditch my trademark.
Programs Used: Heroku. Github. GoogleFu. Mac. 
Acknowledgments: Frank the Cat for being emotionally available for two minutes, Jerome, Manuel, et al.
